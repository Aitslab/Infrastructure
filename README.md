# Infrastructure
In this repository, there are tutorials on how to use the available computational infrastructure we have access for our projects.
Through the Swedish national infrastructure for computing NAISS you can have access to Swestore (storage only), Lunarc, kebnekaise and alvis computational resources in different projects.

To get access you first need to register for a NAISS account as follows:

1. Create a SUPR account at https://supr.naiss.se/ 
For students and employees at Lund University, the most convenient is "Login with Federated Identity", which simply means using your Lucat-ID and password. 

2. Log in to SUPR and accept the user agreement under Personal Information -> NAISS User Agreement. 

3. Inform Sonja once your account is registred so she can add you to the projects.

After this you need to make an account at the resource you want to use. For this, see instructions in the tutorials folder.
