# Infrastructure
In this repository, there will be some tutorials on how to use the available Swedish SNIC clusters we have access for our projects in the Aits Lab.

We have access to Swestore (storage only), Lunarc, kebnekaise and alvis computational resources in different projects.

To get access you first need to register for a snic account as follows:

1. set up a SNIC account in SUPR: https://supr.snic.se/person/register/. If you are affiliated with a Swedish university you should use the 'Register via SWAMID' option with your staff or student ID. 
2. log in to SNIC and accept the user agreement under Personal Information -> SNIC User Agreement. 
3. Inform Sonja once your account is registred so she can add you to the project.

After this you need to make an account at the resource you want to use. For this, see instructions in the tutorials folder.
